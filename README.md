## usb-facade

Application (and dll library for AHK) for reading USB devices directly hence the
name _facade_

## But what do i do with it

Well whatever you want, if you need some inspiration or even have an idea for an
example they go in `examples/`

## AutoHotkey API

Read [ahk_api](src/ahk_api.cc) file, that's the best way to learn

## Planned Features

- A way to preparse the data coming from a device
- Make keyboard listening a easier to parse in AHK as the data is convoluted
